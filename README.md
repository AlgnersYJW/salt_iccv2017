Description:
-----

We propose a video denoising method, based on a novel Sparse And Low-rank Tensor (SALT) model. An efficient and unsupervised
online unitary sparsifying transform learning method is introduced to impose adaptive sparsity on the fly. SALT based video denoising exhibits low latency and can potentially handle streaming videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that combines adaptive sparsity and low-rankness for video denoising, and the first work of solving the proposed problem in an online fashion. 

The SALT package includes (1) a collection of the SALT Matlab functions, and (2) example data used in the SALT paper.
